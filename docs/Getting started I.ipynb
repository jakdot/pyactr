Querying is signaled as \"?manual>\", and the line \"state free\" checks in what state the buffer is - \"state free\" means that the buffer must not carry out any action, otherwise the rule cannot fire (apart from this, two other common queries are \"state busy\", which checks whether the buffer is busy, and \"state error\", which checks whether the action of the buffer ended up in an error - this last option is irrelevant in case of the manual buffer, though)."

    "Now we finally got somewhere. The trace shows that a key was pressed (at 0.5s). You can also see that pressing a key has various stages. First, the action is prepared (at 0.35s), then it is initiated (at 0.4s), and at 0.5s the key is pressed. After that, the movement is finished (it is assumed that the fingers of the model are at the home row of the keyboard, so that finishing the movement entails that the finger has moved back to its original position, a key in the home row). Details are not important here (the motor model simulating typing is taken in ACT-R from EPIC; check EPIC or ACT-R documentation for justification of these stages).\n",
